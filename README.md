# Kunstliche-Intelligenz-AI
WS20/21 Artificial Intelligence course at University of Kaiserslautern (Germany).

## Assignment 1
Create a dataframe with data from WG-Gesucht, a portal for shared apartments and accomodation.

## Assignment 2
- Implement search algorithms by hand (A* and MinMax with Alpha-Beta pruning).
- Implement a class node with a function that performs an alpha-beta search.

## Assignment 3
We the data collected on Assignment 1 for training 2 machine learning models to predict price:

- Linear regression, comparing results using the normal equation vs. gradient descent.
- Fully-connected neural network using the torch library.

## Assignment 4
We use supervised learning to train a classifier to recognize type of activity from an on-body sensor (accelerometer with 3 axes).

We used multiple algorithms built-in the scikit-learn library and then we created a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the classifier.

## Assignment 5
We train a classifier for the [STL-10 dataset](https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/), using pytorch.
We applied transfer learning, training on top of [ResNet34](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), a convolutional neural network.
